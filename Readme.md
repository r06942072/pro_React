# Learning React Note 
## Features:
- React component: 
  - Thinking about repetitive chunk on website, and pack is a a block.
  - modularize the codes, no giant js appear anymore.
  
- JSX files: 
  - Extended JS file, aim to produce React elements
  - put HTML into JavaScriptHTML, so like structures(UI thinking dev) , can also react without JSX
  - React doesnâ€™t require using JSX, but is a helpful visual aid
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html
  
- Babel: 
  - browser does not understand JSX so, before the code can be run, it is converted into browser-compatible JavaScript by a JS compiler, i.e. Babel
  - a JavaScript compiler, from JSX to JS
  - https://babeljs.io/

- React Native:
